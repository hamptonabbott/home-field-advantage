## Abstract

This report quantifies NFL home-field advantage over the 2000–2023 regular seasons and tests whether
the effect has changed across that period. Using 6,175 regular-season games from the nflverse dataset,
home teams won 56.26% of contests with a mean scoring margin of +2.23 points. The advantage is real but
appears to have weakened: the 2000–2008 home win rate of 57.03% fell to 54.84% across 2015–2023, a
decline of 2.19 percentage points. The analysis is descriptive — it characterizes the trend without
claiming a single cause.

## 1. Problem definition

**Research question.** To what extent does home-field advantage influence NFL game outcomes, and how has
that effect changed from 2000 to 2023?

This is an exploratory study aimed at describing patterns in historical data rather than building a
predictive model. The motivating claim — that NFL teams play better at home — is widely repeated by
fans, broadcasters, and bettors; the goal here is to check it against the data and measure how stable
the effect has been over time.

## 2. Data and sample design

**Source.** nflverse `games.csv` (one row per game), retrieved February 18, 2026.

**Fields used.** `season`, `game_type`, `home_score`, `away_score`, `game_id`.

**Filtering.** The sample was narrowed in three steps:

| Step | Games |
|---|---|
| Raw file (1999–2025) | 7,276 |
| Restrict to 2000–2023 | 6,447 |
| Regular season only | 6,175 |

The final sample spans 24 seasons, averaging 257.3 games per season (range 248–272), and contains 14
ties (0.23%).

**Out of scope.** The dataset omits factors that plausibly drive home advantage — travel burden, crowd
size and noise, injuries, and full team-strength controls — so the analysis can describe *what* happened
without isolating *why*.

## 3. Cleaning and preparation

The preparation steps and their rationale:

- **Window (2000–2023).** Enough seasons to study a trend while keeping the focus on the modern game;
  older and post-2023 seasons are excluded.
- **Regular season only.** Postseason structure varies and is labeled `WC`/`DIV`/`CON`/`SB` (not `POST`)
  in this dataset, which made the postseason export unreliable; final claims are therefore restricted to
  the regular season.
- **Numeric scores.** `home_score` and `away_score` were coerced to numeric and rows missing either
  score removed. No regular-season rows were dropped, but the check guards against invalid win/loss
  calculations.
- **Ties handled separately.** `home_win` was set to 1 (home win), 0 (home loss), or `NaN` (tie), with a
  separate `home_tie` flag, so ties are never miscounted as losses.
- **Deduplication.** `game_id` values were verified unique in the final sample.

## 4. Methodology

Three views were used to characterize the effect:

1. **Home win rate by season** — the share of regular-season games won by the home team each year.
2. **Five-year rolling average** of home win rate. A 5-year window was chosen deliberately: 2- or 3-year
   windows leave too much noise and can make ordinary fluctuation look like a trend break, while a very
   long window hides genuine shifts. Five years smooths short-term noise while still exposing major moves
   such as 2020.
3. **Home scoring-margin distribution** — because a binary win/loss obscures *how much* home teams win
   by, the distribution of `home_score − away_score` adds magnitude to the picture.

## 5. Results

**Overall effect.** Across 6,175 regular-season games, home teams won **56.26%** of the time, with a
mean home margin of **+2.23** points (mean home score 23.17; mean away score 20.94).

**Trend over time.** The advantage has narrowed:

| Period | Home win rate |
|---|---|
| 2000–2008 | 57.03% |
| 2015–2023 | 54.84% |
| Change | −2.19 pts |

**Extremes.** The lowest season in the sample is **2020 at 49.80%** — the only season home teams did not
win a majority — and the highest is **2003 at 61.33%**. Home win rate rebounds somewhat after 2020 but
remains below most early-2000s seasons.

## 6. Interpretation and limitations

The defensible conclusion is narrow: home-field advantage still exists across this period but appears
weaker than it was in the early 2000s. The data supports a *trend*, not a cause. It would be misleading
to claim the advantage is gone, that crowd noise is the sole driver, or that this analysis establishes
causation.

**Limitations.** No controls for team, quarterback, or coaching quality; no direct attendance or
crowd-noise variable; neutral-site and international games are not modeled separately. A small percentage
shift still matters across thousands of games — but honest analysis means stating clearly what the data
can and cannot show.

**Next steps.** Add attendance data to test crowd-related hypotheses directly, separate
neutral-site/international games, introduce team-strength controls, and compare periods with a formal
statistical test rather than period averages.
